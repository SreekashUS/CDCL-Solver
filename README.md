# CDCL-Solver
---
This is a simple implementation of Conflict Driven Clause Learning SAT solver.

## TODO
---
1. Fix broken solver along with some changes to project structure (use Cmake)
2. Add support from a HDL parser to make simple logic gates
3. Add systemverilog property checks for simple SAT solving or use existing solvers like Z3, MiniSAT etc
4. Make a DFT engine to create faults and use gate level netlist to solve for test vectors
5. Implement Heuristics for solving SAT
